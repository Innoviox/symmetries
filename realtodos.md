# Real Todos

- make lines thicker
- make lines move more obviously
- un-gradient the cube
- toggle seeing lines vs cube
- make spheres move with cube (optional, if we don't maybe don't show spheres)
  - i think we just hide the cube while animation is happening
- make spheres smaller
- make it more obvious when a diagonal is flipping (animate flips last?)
